# ElewonGSI - Game Server Installer
---

**ElewonGSI** is a lightweight and beginner-friendly Bash script that helps you set up a game server on Linux with just a few terminal commands. No complex configuration, no unnecessary steps — just clone, run, and play.

## 📦 Source Code & Remote Execution
This project is fully open source, with all complete script files publicly available in this GitHub repository. <br>
➡️ You are free to explore, modify, and contribute to the code at any time.<br>

To ensure users always have access to the latest updates and fixes, the installer scripts automatically fetch their latest versions directly from our official server

This hybrid approach combines the best of both worlds: <br>
✅ Transparency and community collaboration through GitHub <br>
✅ Seamless, lightweight installation and automatic updates via remote fetching
